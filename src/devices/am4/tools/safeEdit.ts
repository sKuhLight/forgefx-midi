/**
 * AM4 safe-edit guard — pre-navigation dirty check.
 *
 * Source of truth (preferred): the DEVICE-TRUE "edited" bit, read via a
 * GET_PATCH descriptor read (`readActiveBufferEditedBit` — `byte[21] & 0x04`).
 * Confirmed on hardware 2026-06-03: it holds 0x00 at rest, flips to 0x04 on
 * any working-buffer edit (ours, front-panel, or AM4-Edit), and returns to
 * 0x00 on save. This catches out-of-band front-panel / parallel-editor edits
 * that the in-memory tracker is blind to (the AM4 emits no push on those,
 * HW-107), and it correctly reads clean after a front-panel save.
 *
 * Fallback: the deterministic in-memory `isDirty(AM4_DIRTY_LABEL)` flag from
 * the shared `bufferDirty` tracker, used only when the device read fails
 * (timeout / device busy). `markDirty` fires at every AM4 edit-class write
 * call site (writer.ts / applyExecutor.ts / presetRestore.ts); `markClean`
 * fires on save / switch. It reliably reflects OUR edits.
 *
 * Why not the working-buffer fingerprint poll this replaced: the AM4 dump is
 * non-deterministic (~20% byte drift on a zero-mutation re-dump, warm-pair
 * capture 2026-05-28), so a hash comparison both fails-open and false-refuses.
 * A real v0.1.0 user hit the false refusal — `apply_preset` to a location
 * refused for "unsaved edits" immediately after a clean `save_preset` to it.
 * The single device-true bit is deterministic and unit-testable; the
 * in-memory flag backstops it.
 *
 * Modes (cross-device contract, see `docs/SAFE-EDIT-WORKFLOW.md`):
 *   - `'warn'` (default) — dirty → refuse with a structured warning.
 *   - `'discard'` — caller opted in to losing edits; proceed without touching
 *     the flag or the connection.
 *   - `'save_active_first'` — dirty → save the working buffer to the active
 *     location (ack-gated), `markClean`, then proceed.

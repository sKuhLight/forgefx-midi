/**
 * FM9 device-true enum overrides (read-leg {broadcast ordinal -> name}).
 *
 * The gen-3 family shares one effect codec, but the model rosters (amp / drive
 * selectors) are device-specific: FM9 ordinals do NOT match the III/FM3 or AM4
 * tables. The amp and drive (FUZZ) rosters below are the FM9's OWN model lists,
 * mined from the FM9-Edit `effectDefinitions` cache (firmware 11.0) and emitted
 * by `scripts/gen-fm9-rosters-from-cache.ts`. Each is VALIDATED at generation
 * time against the FM9 hardware ordinal anchors:
 *   - amp: 65=SV Bass 2, 179=Texas Star Clean, 264=SV Bass 1
 *   - FUZZ/drive: 15=Blues OD, 36=Blackglass 7K
 * and each carries a self-validating `uint32` entry-count prefix in the cache
 * (amp 331 / drive 86). The broadcast ordinal IS the discrete-SET value (a select
 * sends float32(ordinal)), so these are both read labels AND settable by name
 * across the whole roster, not just the captured anchor points.
 *
 * REVERB_TYPE binds the device-true FM9 reverb roster (79) too. The cache gives
 * the FM9's own adjective-first form ("Medium Spring", "Music Hall"), what an
 * FM9 user reads on the unit and in FM-Edit. This SUPERSEDES the prior read-leg
 * fallback that borrowed AM4 REVERB_TYPES' noun-first names ("Spring, Medium",
 * "Hall, Music"), which mislabeled FM9 read-backs. The ordinal join is intact
 * (gen-3 ordinal N == AM4 REVERB_TYPES[N] semantically; only the display word
 * order differs), and set-by-name stays tolerant of BOTH forms via the
 * word-order-tolerant resolver, so "Spring, Medium" and "Medium Spring" both
 * still resolve to ordinal 16. III/FM3 keep the AM4-borrowed names until their
 * own device caches arrive.
 *
 * DISTORT_FBTYPE (amp voicing) and FILTER_TYPE remain PARTIAL hardware-captured
 * points: only the ordinals the tester selected are bound; the catalog passes
 * every other ordinal through as a raw number and never fabricates a name. Their
 * full rosters await a cache mine or a Type-dropdown capture.
 *
 * Provenance for the full rosters: the community FM9 cache set archived
 * 2026-06-09 (D. MacVicar); decode + adversarial validation in
 * `samples/captured/fm9-community-2026-06-09/FINDINGS.md`. Partial points:
 * `docs/_private/FM9-CAPTURE-RECEIVE+SWEEP-2026-06-04.md` and the cookbook entry
 * `gen3-enum-label-septet-stream`.

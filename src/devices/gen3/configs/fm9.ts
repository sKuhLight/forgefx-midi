/**
 * FM9 config for `createModernFractalDescriptor`.
 *
 * The FM9 (model byte 0x12) is a gen-3 sibling of the Axe-Fx III: same
 * SysEx envelope, same 6×14 grid, 8 scenes, A–D channels. It now ships a
 * DEVICE-TRUE param catalog (`fractal-midi/gen3/fm9`) mined from FM9-Edit's own
 * binary — block roster + effect IDs are the III's (shared across the
 * family), but paramIds are FM9's own (reusing the III's mis-addresses
 * 18.6% of shared params; see `docs/_private/MINING-FINDINGS-FM-VP4.md`).
 * Model byte 0x12 is HARDWARE-CONFIRMED on a real FM9 (firmware 11.0,
 * community fm9-catalog foundation probe, 2026-06-06): a QUERY PATCH NAME
 * built with 0x12 echoes model 0x12 with a valid checksum, scene GET/SET
 * (fn 0x0C) round-trips with the front panel following, and STATUS_DUMP
 * (fn 0x13) framing matches the III family. The FM9 returns NO Universal
 * Identity Reply, so a Fractal-native query is the ID path. community-beta
 * (the explicit-effectId SET path is still owner-round-trip pending).

/**
 * Channel awareness + applicability advisory state shared by every tool
 * that writes to or reads a channel-bearing block (amp / drive / reverb /
 * delay).
 *
 * Channels (A/B/C/D) are the data container for block param values; scenes
 * are selectors that choose which channel each block uses. Two scenes
 * pointing at the same channel will both reflect any write to that channel,
 * confirmed on hardware HW-009 (2026-04-19). See SYSEX-MAP.md §6a and
 * docs/_private/HARDWARE-TASKS.md HW-009 for the full explanation.
 *
 * The cache below holds whatever channel the server LAST EXPLICITLY SET
 * for each channel-bearing block. It is not authoritative — a hardware
 * footswitch, hardware knob, or AM4-Edit interaction can move the block
 * to a different channel without our knowledge. The cache is invalidated
 * on `am4_switch_preset` / `am4_switch_scene` / `reconnect_midi` to avoid
 * reporting stale data across those boundaries.

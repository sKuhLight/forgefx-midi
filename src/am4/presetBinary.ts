/**
 * AM4 preset binary — field decoders + encoders.
 *
 * The 12,352-byte AM4 preset binary (see §10b in
 * `docs/devices/am4/SYSEX-MAP.md`) is the body of the 6-message stream
 * (`0x77` header + 4× `0x78` chunks + `0x79` footer) emitted by the
 * device in response to `buildRequestActiveBufferDump` (fn `0x03` with
 * `7F 7F 00` payload) or read sequentially from the factory bank file.
 *
 * Decoded fields so far:
 *
 *   - Preset name: 32-char ASCII, chunk-1 offset `0x0C` (= frame
 *     offset `0x21`), 48 wire bytes, 3-byte-per-2-char chunked
 *     encoding. Recovered 2026-05-21 from  calibration captures
 *     (`samples/exports/{ABCDEFG, Test 1234}.syx`).
 *
 * The remaining structured fields (block-type IDs, parameter values,
 * per-scene bypass / channel state, routing) are NOT yet mapped; same
 * calibration methodology (apply known state, dump, diff) is the path
 * to decode them.
 *
 * # Name wire format
 *
 * 48 wire bytes = 16 independent 3-byte groups, each carrying 2 ASCII
 * characters with 5 padding bits. Each group is independent — high
 * bits of char1 do NOT spill into the next group. This is NOT the
 * standard 8-to-7 sliding-window pack from §6b; it's a discrete
 * 2-char-per-3-byte chunked encoding.
 *
 *     byte0 = char0 & 0x7F                              (low 7 bits of char0)
 *     byte1 = (char0 >> 7) | ((char1 & 0x3F) << 1)      (high bit of char0 + low 6 bits of char1)
 *     byte2 = (char1 >> 6) & 0x03                       (high 2 bits of char1, in bits 0-1)
 *
 * The 32-char buffer is space-padded for the first 31 positions and
 * NUL-terminated at position 31 (the device always writes `\0` in the
 * 32nd byte, not a trailing space — confirmed against every active
 * export captured to date).

/**
 * Shared safe-edit primitives — schema/types used by every device's
 * `*_apply_preset_at` / `*_apply_setlist` / `*_switch_preset` tools.
 *
 * The contract these primitives implement is documented in
 * `docs/SAFE-EDIT-WORKFLOW.md`:
 *
 *   1. Buffer-dirty gate (`on_active_preset_edited`) — navigating
 *      away from an edited working buffer requires explicit
 *      authorization (warn / discard / save_active_first).
 *   2. Save-authorization gate (`save_authorized`) — apply-and-save
 *      tools refuse unless the caller has explicitly authorized the
 *      destructive save.
 *
 * Per-device guard FUNCTIONS live in each device's own module because
 * the warning text references device-specific slot/location naming
 * (AM4 location codes A01–Z04 vs Axe-Fx II preset numbers 1..16384)
 * and the dirty-source-of-truth varies (device-broadcast on Axe-Fx II,
 * code-side classifier on AM4, n/a on Hydrasynth). The SHAPES below
 * are device-agnostic — same parameter name, same enum values, same
 * description, so an agent that learned the pattern on one device
 * recognizes it on every other.

/**
 * Factory-preset fingerprints — derived at runtime from the user's local
 * copy of `samples/factory/AM4-Factory-Presets-1p01.syx`.
 *
 * A fingerprint is a SHA-256 hash over the four chunk payloads of one
 * preset dump (4 × 3074 = 12,296 bytes), encoded as a hex string. The
 * 0x77 header is excluded because it encodes the target location, which
 * differs between an export of the active preset (uses the 0x7F sentinel)
 * and a stored-export (uses the real bank/sub-index). The 0x79 footer is
 * excluded because it's a header-or-content-derived value (SYSEX-MAP.md
 * §10b — believed to be a content checksum, but its exact derivation is
 * not yet pinned down). Hashing only the chunks gives us a fingerprint
 * that's stable across export contexts.
 *
 * Fingerprints are NOT committed. Two reasons:
 *   1. Avoid distributing derived metadata of Fractal-IP content. The
 *      hashes are one-way, but the cleaner story is "you provide the
 *      bank file; we derive fingerprints locally."
 *   2. Firmware-version drift — if Fractal ships a new factory bank in
 *      a future firmware update, the user drops in the new bank file
 *      and the gate re-classifies correctly without a code change.
 *
 * Performance: hashing 104 × ~12 KB chunks takes a few ms. Done once at
 * server start; cached for the lifetime of the process.

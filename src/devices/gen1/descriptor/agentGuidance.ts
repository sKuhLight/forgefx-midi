    'route, save, while USBPcap or MIDI Monitor records) is the single unlock — the how-to is ' +

    'query(0) returns a MIDI_PARAM_VALUE response carrying the live value and the device\'s own label ' +
    'string. get_param / get_params are wired and return that label as ground truth. BUT this is decoded ' +
    'from the spec and UNCONFIRMED on hardware (the project owns no gen-1 unit): if a read times out the ' +
    'tool returns no_ack — fall back to the front panel and report the result so we can confirm gen-1 ' +
    'reads. Whole-preset dump (get_preset) is NOT wired yet.',
  capabilities:
    'Supported: set_param / set_params (full parameter WRITE surface, 922 params / 35 blocks), ' +
    'get_param / get_params (community-beta read-back), and describe_device / list_params / lookup-style ' +
    'introspection. NOT supported: apply_preset / get_preset / whole-patch dump, save, scene/channel ops, ' +
    'and block placement — the published gen-1 spec documents only the parameter function (0x02), so the ' +
    'structural wire paths are unknown (not gated, unknown). Those refuse with capability_not_supported; ' +

  preset_workflow:
    'The practical gen-1 workflow: switch presets with send_program_change (standard MIDI Program ' +
    'Change — works on gen-1 like any MIDI device; bank select CC0 first for presets past 127 per the ' +
    "device's manual), then reshape the loaded preset with set_param / set_params. \"Pick the closest " +
    'preset, then repaint it\" covers most tone requests; what gen-1 cannot do is author a block chain ' +
    'from scratch (no placement wire path). When the user asks for a from-scratch build, say exactly ' +
    'that and offer the switch-then-tweak path instead.',
  scaling:
    'Most knobs are display-first (0..10, dB, Hz). Some params the doc marks non-linear have no decoded ' +
    'curve and take a raw wire value 0..254 — list_params shows which. Pass the front-panel reading for ' +
    'display-first params; for the raw ones, set and confirm on the panel.',
